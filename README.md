# Elevator Saga Typescript

This repo contains Typescript type definitions for the [Elevator Saga](https://play.elevatorsaga.com/) game.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

## Running

Write your solution in [`src/solution.ts` (link)](/src/solution.ts).  
Make sure the solution in its **entirety** is within the `solution` const.  
Then run:

```bash
npm run copy
```

or

```bash
yarn copy
```

This will turn the contents into JavaScript and copy it to the clipboard - you should be able to paste directly into the game!
